# For People using Replit

Replit doesn't allow you to install the package globally so you will need to require `pn_start` if you wish to create command files and the same with `pn_arcs` to load simple command handler bot.


```js
const {pn_start,pn_arcs,Log} = require('pn_arcs')

Log() //log does nothing more then just console.log("Im Ready")
//if you wish to create command file use pn_start 

pn_start()

```
!!Reminder to remove `pn_start ` from your `index.js` after you created your command file. You can require it again if you wish to create an another comamnd file

# For People using ``<Vs Code>`` as your platform 
>
### No need to use this Package
`JavaScript` has something call `User Snippets` where you can make it so it loades your command/code. Go to Manage/Settings > User Snippets > and JavaScript.

```js
{
// Place your snippets for javascript here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	// "Print to console": {
	// 	"prefix": "log",
	// 	"body": [
	// 		"console.log('$1');",
	// 		"$2"
	// 	],
	// 	"description": "Log output to console"
	// }
}
```
